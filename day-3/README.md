# What will you learn 

## Introduction to EC2:
```
most widey use and one of the most important service in aws here we understand what,why and types ,regions an az
```
What is EC2, and why is it important?

```
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
-elastic prefix whenever aws provide service that can be scale up and scale down acc to the requirements then aws use elastic prefix with the services name
-it's virtual server
- managment effort gone down by using ec2
-it's pay-as-you go model which help organizations in order to maintain the cost
- Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
- Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
- Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.
```

EC2 usecases

```
Deliver secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.
Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.
Access environments in minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWS’s pay-as-you-go pricing.
Deliver the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services purpose-built to optimize price performance for ML projects
```

EC2 Instance Types

Recommended to follow [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) page for very detailed and updated information.

General purpose

```
General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers,
small databases, development and test environments, and more.
```

Compute optimized

```
Compute Optimized instances provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory. They excel in workloads that require high-performance processing such as batch processing, 
scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.
```

Memory optimized

```
Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts of memory, such as in-memory databases,
real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.
```

Storage optimized

```
Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. 
They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.
```

Accelerated computing

```
Accelerated Computing Instances typically come with one or more types of accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). 
These accelerators offload computationally intensive tasks from the main CPU, enabling faster and more efficient processing for specific workloads.

    i – Intel processors

    d – Instance store volumes

    n – Network and EBS optimized

    e – Extra storage or memory

    z – High performance
```

## EC2 Instance Basics:

Understanding the concept of virtual servers and instances.
Key components of an EC2 instance: AMI (Amazon Machine Image), instance types, and instance states.
Differentiating between On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot instances.

## Launching an EC2 Instance:

- Step-by-step guide on launching an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console.
- Configuring instance details, such as instance type, network settings, and storage options.
- Understanding security groups and key pairs for securing instances.

## Managing EC2 Instances:

- Starting, stopping, and terminating instances.
- Monitoring instance performance and utilization.
- Basic troubleshooting and accessing instances using SSH (Secure Shell).

```
Region (AWS Region):
A Region is a geographical location in the world where AWS has a cluster of data centers.

Each Region is isolated and independent to ensure the highest possible fault tolerance and stability.

Example Regions:

us-east-1 (N. Virginia)

ap-south-1 (Mumbai)

eu-west-1 (Ireland)

🔹 Key Points:
Each Region has multiple Availability Zones.

Regions help with data residency, latency, and regulatory compliance.
```
```
Availability Zone (AZ):
An Availability Zone is a physically separate data center (or group of data centers) within a Region.

Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and networking, but they are interconnected through low-latency links.

Example: ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b, ap-south-1c are AZs in the Mumbai Region.

🔹 Key Points:
Using multiple AZs provides high availability and fault tolerance.

If one AZ fails, services in another AZ can continue running.
